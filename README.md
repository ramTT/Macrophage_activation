# Macrophage Polarization post  Spinal Cord Injury

## M1/M2 ratio following mesenchymal stem cell treatment

**Aim:** Script aims at determining the M1/M2 ratio of macrophages in the spinal cord 20 days post spinal cord injury (SCI).  

**Study design:**   
* *Experimental groups:* I) SCI+medium, II) SCI+syngeneic MSCs, III) SCI+allogenic MSCs, IV) SCI+mouse stromal vascular fraction (mSVF).  

* *Time points:* Transplantation (if applicable) 24 h post SCI. Sacrifice and evaluation at 20 days post SCI.  

* *Markers:* M1: CD16, CD32. M2: Arg1, CD206.  

**Statistical analysis:**  

* *Distribution* of M1/M2 was estimated on 1000 bootstrapped data replicates for M1 and M2 separately.  

* *Correlation* between M1/M2 ratio and pro-inflammation was estimated using Spearman's rank correlation and Kendalls rank correlation coefficient.
